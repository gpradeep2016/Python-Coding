D.R.Y.  --> Do not repeat yourself.
        --> There should be a single source of truth

Code smell --> Code that works but has some awkwardness in intelligibility or maintainability

Refactoring --> Rearranging and simplifying code to remove redundancy
                without changing functionality.

Inheritance --> It is a tool for code reuse and nothing else.
                One class gets to reuse the code from another class.
